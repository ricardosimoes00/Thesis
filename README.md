More information about the work developed can be found in the documents "Tese.pdf" and "Extended_Abstract.pdf".

## Content

The folder "Code" contains the code of the project. 
The folder "Models" contains the weights of the models used in this project

The following example shows how to train and test a SUNN model 

Invoking goals on files is straightforward, e.g.,
